                </header>
                <p>I'm currently an Associate DevOps Engineer at PowerSchool, located in Folsom, California. I have a passion for web development, with experience in multiple languages and frameworks for both. In May 2019, I graduated Cum Laude from California State University, Sacramento with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a certificate in Game Engineering. Some of my hobbies include <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16552310-richard-wright" target="_blank">reading books</a> and blogs, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/123095168?si=q24pdybvRneL2V-VxLWRcg" target="_blank">listening to music</a>, playing board and video games, and watching sports (hockey and baseball being my favorites).</p>

                <h3><b>Lemur Certificate Manager</b><br/><sub><i>PowerSchool</i> (current project)</sub></h3>
                <p>Working with another DevOps Engineer to implement the Open Source certificate manager <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Lemur">"Lemur"</a> created by Netflix. This involved demoing a proof of concept, as well writing plugins to extend Lemur and allow it to integrate with the APIâ€™s used by the Certificate Authorities we use.</p>
                <p>Lemur is written in Python and we updated the built-in front end by upgrading it from AngularJS to Angular 7.</p>

                <h3><b>API Reference Web App</b><br/><sub><i>VSP Global</i></sub></h3>
                <p>For this project, our team created an API Reference web application based on the <a href="https://swagger.io/" target="#">Swagger</a> specification. Instead of generating documentation from the source code with Swagger annotations, our app allowed developers to easily and quickly write docs via our client.</p>
                <p>Our web app was built with Angular, Java, and Spring.</p>
              </li>

                <h3><b>Provider and Lab Network API</b><br/><sub><i>VSP Global</i></sub></h3>
                <p>The goal of this project was to convert existing Provider Network and Lab Network databases to SQL Server and write an API that would query the new databases. This allowed VSP to take the old databases off the mainframe, aiding in its eventual retirement. Our API would be under heavy use daily (tens of thousands of calls or more) so it was crucial that we use time and space saving techniques, such as caching and load balancing. We also tested our code extensively with JUnit.</p>
                <p>Provider and Lab Network API were written in Java. The technologies we used were Spring, JPA, and SQL Server.</p>

                <h3><b>University Union Lost & Found</b><br/><sub><i>CSU Sacramento</i></sub></h3>
                <p>For Senior Project, my team and I developed a lost and found web application for the main student center on campus, the University Union. The first semester was spent defining the requirements of the software (in the form of user stories), creating a backlog of features, and prioritizing those features. The second semester, we developed the application, using the SCRUM methodology in order to make sure the software met the demands of our client and was delivered on time.</p>
                <p>University Union Lost and Found was built with Angular, Java, Spring, JPA, and MySQL.</p>

                <h3><b>Chessnobyl</b><br/><sub><i>CSU Sacramento</i></sub></h3>
                <p>Chessnobyl is an AI programmed for CSc 180, Intelligent Systems, at CSU Sacramento. It was created to play a custom chess variant imagined by our professor. Out of more than twenty student-created AIs, Chessnobyl finished in the top 5 after a multiday competition.</p>
                <p>Chessnobyl was written in C++ and implements AI algorithms such as Minimax, Alpha Beta Pruning, and Iterative deepening.</p>
                <p>The source code for Chessnobyl can be found <a href="https://github.com/rbwrightjr91/CSc-180---Chessnobyl/" target="#">on my GitHub</a>.</p>
